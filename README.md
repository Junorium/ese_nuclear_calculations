## 2. Monte Carlo Simulations
**Application**: Simulating random neutron transport or decay processes in a nuclear reactor.  
**Demo**: I will use Monte Carlo methods to simulate the random walk of neutrons or other particles within a nuclear reactor, showing their paths and interactions.  
**Tools**: NumPy for random sampling.

## 3. Solving Differential Equations (ODE/PDE)
**Application**: Modeling reactor kinetics or heat conduction problems in reactor materials.  
**Demo**: Using Python’s SciPy, I'll solve a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) for heat diffusion or reactor power balance, showing how real-time simulation works.

## 4. Reactor Core Visualization using 3D Libraries
**Application**: 3D visualization of nuclear fuel rod layouts and coolant flow.  
**Demo**: I'll use libraries like `matplotlib` or `Mayavi` to plot a 3D reactor core and animate the flow of coolant or power density in different zones.  
**Tools**: Mayavi, Matplotlib.

## 5. Radiation Shielding Simulation
**Application**: Simulating radiation penetration through shielding materials.  
**Demo**: A basic shielding problem will be solved, where the attenuation of radiation is computed through various materials, showing the exponential decay and effectiveness of different shields.  
**Tools**: SymPy, SciPy.

## 6. Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance
**Application**: Predicting equipment failure based on sensor data from nuclear reactors.  
**Demo**: Using a basic machine learning model, I will predict when a reactor component might fail based on past operational data (e.g., temperature, pressure).  
**Tools**: Scikit-learn.

## 7. Nuclear Cross-Section Data Analysis
**Application**: Analyze nuclear reaction cross-sections and their temperature dependence.  
**Demo**: I'll download nuclear cross-section data from libraries like ENDF, and plot cross-sections vs. energy or temperature, highlighting key patterns.  
**Tools**: Pandas for data handling, Matplotlib for plotting.

## 8. Optimization Problems (Fuel Loading)
**Application**: Optimize the placement of fuel rods in a reactor for maximum efficiency.  
**Demo**: Using optimization libraries, I'll solve a simple fuel loading problem, minimizing cost or maximizing burnup with constraints like temperature or neutron flux.  
**Tools**: SciPy optimization library.

## 9. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for Thermal Analysis
**Application**: Thermal stress and heat transfer in reactor components.  
**Demo**: I’ll show a simple 2D thermal analysis using Python to solve heat transfer equations for reactor components using finite element methods (FEM).  
**Tools**: FEniCS, NumPy.

## 10. Control Systems Simulation (Reactor Control)
**Application**: Simulating reactor control systems (PID controllers for reactor temperature/power).  
**Demo**: Implementing a basic PID controller, I’ll demonstrate how to maintain reactor temperature or power levels, with real-time control simulation.  
**Tools**: Control, NumPy.
